But the digital experience of public services has languished, a clunky relic of bureaucracy, to the point that it's diminishing overall civilian engagement. Kaizen Labs sets out to change that. They're bringing easy-to-use interfaces to government services for both the public and administrators, with a mission to revolutionize civic engagement and restore the public's trust in government services.

He was scared, he told us on our latest episode of Spotlight On. He didn’t want to just tack on AI features, and didn’t know exactly how a workflow tool would fit in or add value to this new world. He felt that if the company were going to survive AI, they'd need to fundamentally reimagine n8n in he process. Fast-forward three years, and n8n is not only a breakout name in AI, but increasingly proving itself as an essential component to AI architecture and orchestration.

""Expanding to the U.S."" almost always meant ""expanding to New York"" in practice. 2. The lists of names search firm returned that met all the criteria these founders had for B2B tech executives in New York were short – worryingly short. Those observations fueled this research with True Search, which examines what's happening in New York's tech scene, how it's shaping the talent pool there, and how founders can successfully navigate it. San Francisco's resurgence this past year has been well-documented and rightly celebrated. But the data and conversations we had with founders revealed that, quietly in the background, New York's emerged as another true B2B tech capital. And it's one, as Squarespace's Anthony Casalena put it, with an identity all its own.

My recent conversation with Vishal Sikka was exactly that. From leading SAP's HANA revolution and driving Infosys' transformation to now reimagining enterprise AI at Vianai Systems, Inc., Vishal has lived at the intersection of technology, philosophy and leadership. We spoke about what ""enterprise-grade AI"" really means in a world obsessed with speed over reliability, why enterprises are more like mangrove forests than machines (intricate, resilient & capable of withstanding shocks) and how India can shape the future of AI through its unique blend of scale, talent and systems thinking. Besides, if there's anyone who can weave an analogy between mangrove forests and enterprises and make it click, it's Vishal! These are insights that could only come from someone who has built, led and now re-imagines what the enterprise of the future looks like.

From day one, the team has been clear in their goal: to enable small & mid-sized businesses in Tier 2-4 cities to access formal credit. Their tech-led NBFC platform combines all the right ingredients, blending speed, data-driven underwriting and disciplined risk management. With ~₹315 crore in AUM and on track to cross ₹400 crore by FY26, Techfino's journey is a testament to the scale of MSME credit demand in India, which is estimated at ₹2 lakh crore+ every quarter.

Global software spending has surged to nearly $900 billion. Software companies have high upfront investment and strong gross margins. In contrast, services businesses require less capital to start and scale linearly with leaner gross margins.Over the past decade, software businesses have dominated the spotlight due to their repeatable revenue streams, fast cash collection, and attractive margins. With the right PMF and a scalable GTM strategy, they can grow rapidly, which explains why SaaS companies command high valuations despite their linear sales processes.Services, on the other hand, often lack differentiation and predictability. Operating under a âweâll do whatever you needâ blanket, they struggle to achieve clear product-market fit till they reach a certain scale. For these businesses, their ability to grow rely on factors like sales capabilities, delivery scalability, cost management, and securing long-term contracts. As these companies mature, they often attract growth-stage or private equity investors. The emergence of large language models (LLM) has dramatically altered the frontier of what is possible for machines to do, particularly for tasks that are sequential and involve both unstructured and structured data. As a result of this, there are two key trends weâre seeing:AI agents are taking over many tasks that are either being done in-house by companies or by services companies, cutting down on the need for human effort.As software becomes more AI native, its inherent inaccuracies will make a human-in-the-loop layer essential to keep everything running smoothly.While #1 is widely understood today, we believe that there is a lack of appreciation for #2. AI software are fundamentally probabilistic, and are prone to hallucinations. Even 90% accuracy is considered high. Some of this may be acceptable for low criticality applications e.g. prediction of next movie a user may want to see, or autocomplete in a text box. However, for most business works, this is not acceptable. Take, for instance, a real estate software startup we recently spoke with. Theyâre focused on automating the closing process for residential real estate transactions in the US. This process involves multiple steps, including exchanging emails and scanned documents, extracting key information, performing actions based on that data, navigating and inputting information into packaged software, and handling payment transactions. In total, there are around 20-50 such micro-steps. Even if each individual step has an accuracy rate of over 95%, the likelihood of completing all 20 steps without any errors drops to just 35%. This highlights the complexity and potential for errors in automating such intricate workflows. For 50 steps, the probability drops to just 7.5%. You canât afford to manage a $1M+ transaction with a 90% chance of error!Today, most software companies offer AI solutions but place the responsibility for outcomes on the buyer. However, we believe that over the next decade, a growing number of companies will emerge that provide both software and services. These services wonât be limited to one-time implementation; they will also include ongoing, human-led support to manage edge cases and ensure oversight, guaranteeing the accuracy and reliability of AI-driven outputs.The emergence of âPlatform BPOâ companiesThe nature of these emerging companies is neither purely software nor services, but a true hybrid of both. Traditional services companies typically offer a wide range of services, operating on a simple principle: once inside an account, expand as much as possible. The lines between âwhat we doâ and âwhat we donâtâ are often blurred, leading to continuous service expansion. As contracts grow larger and longer, sales costs as a percentage of revenue decrease, while resource utilisation â an essential driver of profitability â increases, thanks to more predictable, long-term engagements. For Indian services firms, an additional profit driver is the ability to offshore a significant portion of their workforce. This strategy has helped create global giants like TCS and Infosys, built on this very model.Itâs important to remember that even software companies often need services â sometimes seen as a necessary evil. When working with large enterprises, consulting, implementation, and ongoing support are crucial. While these services typically carry lower margins than software itself, they are essential for ensuring value realization and reducing churn, making them indispensable. Software companies also require significant upfront investment and continuous R&D to stay competitive. As a result, most remain highly focused on their core offerings. Itâs usually only when they reach $100M+ in ARR that they start e...",,allinvestorinvestorsThank you! Your submission has been received!Oops!

Blume Ventures ,https://www.blume.vc/,careers@blume.vc,022-43471659,"Unit 1, Jetha Industrial Compound, Opp Nirmal Park, Byculla East, Mumbai, Maharashtra","Blume's Beliefs - Blume Ventures Menu Home Blume's Beliefs Work With Us Initiatives People Portfolio Library News Search the site: Search Omega Files Episode 2Share Share via Email Share on WhatsApp Share on LinkedIn Share on X (Twitter) Blume's Beliefs Transformational Companies Are Led And Built By Revolutionary Founders. We Back These Founders Early And Remain Lifelong Partners. You cannot buy the revolution. You cannot make the revolution. You can only be the revolution. It is in your spirit, or it is nowhere. Ursula K Le Guin The Dispossessed In 2010, Karthik Reddy and Sanjay Nath founded Blume Ventures with a mission to reimagine startup financing for India. As passionate angel investors in the fledgling Indian startup ecosystem, they foresaw the evolution of the Indian startup founder and sought to create a firm that would support the Indian founder through the entire journey of starting up to scaling up. To do this, they founded a distinctive venture firm, one that could move with the speed of an angel investor, yet be institutionalised in its approach, bridging a gap between local angel networks and larger global venture capital firms.Over the years, Blume has grown by backing transformational ventures and revolutionary founders, becoming a key player in India’s startup ecosystem. En route, we have invested in and helped build over 100 startups across geographies and verticals. All these startups are united by a common theme: they are looking to solve uniquely Indian problems, ones that emerge out of the vast complexities of building for and operating in the Indian sub-continent, with its 23 official languages, distinct cultural groups and disparate income levels. While the solutions are for India, their aspirations and attitudes are global, and they remind us that the next wave of global startups are emerging out of India.Capital, counsel, and convictionThe distinctive nature of the Indian startup ecosystem and the unique context it operates in places a unique challenge on the founder. Blume is distinctive for its deep empathy for the founder’s hardships as well as the full range of support provided to make their journey easier. Our empathy with the founder’s quest and the challenges they face results from our deep commitment to the problems they work on as well as our personal motivations to effect change.Beyond the capital that we provide, to our founders, they also have on-demand counsel and support, via access to our services partners Constellation Blu (financial and legal advisory-cum-compliance), MetaMorph (recruitment), as well as our in house resources providing access to growth capital, sales and strategic partnerships and community. But beyond capital and counsel, we also provide conviction, sticking and standing by our founders through all the winding paths they take to achieve scale and success. Sometimes it doesn’t work out, for more often than not, startups are experiments that don’t succeed. Well, that is all right too, we then help pull the founders pull down shutters, and then get ready to back their next experiments. Backing founders and their unreasonable experiments, after all is what Blume was born for.Divided by motivation, united by ambitionThe founders who partner with us, or rather who we had the privilege of partnering with, are a diverse lot. They don’t fit any particular demographic profile nor do they conform to any specific pedigree. They may be building B2C ventures or B2B ventures. Their customers may be housewives in Bharat or enterprise CXOs in the Bay Area. Irrespective of these differences, we find that they are all obsessed with solving hard problems, usually one triggering a fundamental change in consumer behaviour and birthing large markets.We typically partner with these founders at a very early stage, helping them achieve product-market fit and power through the first point of scale. We bring in capital and counsel, but more importantly, we bring our conviction. We remain steadfast supporters to these founders, staying invested for anywhere from eight to ten years, and as long as the founders are equally invested in their ambition for the business. Supporting and sticking by founders and their crazy ambitions is what Blume was designed for. This is why Blume exists, and why we come excited to work every day. Transformational ventures are built by revolutionary founders.

He shares personal anecdotes and insights that reveal the human side of corporate leadership, including his close working relationship with Ratan Tata and the lessons learned along the way.Key topics discussed:Dr Rajan’s unique childhood experiences across various countriesThe evolution of the Tata Group and its global impactPersonal stories that highlight Ratan Tata’s leadership styleThe history, purpose, and challenges of Tata Administrative Services (TAS) in building sustainable leadershipDr Rajan’s role in launching one of India’s premier airline services ​‘Vistara’ , and its futureBalancing tradition with innovation in today’s business landscapeInsights into sustainable leadership and the future of Indian businessDon’t miss this inspiring conversation with Dr. Mukund Rajan as he shares valuable leadership lessons, behind-the-scenes stories from the Tata Group, and his vision for a sustainable future. Whether you’re an aspiring entrepreneur, a business leader, or simply curious about the legacy of one of India’s most iconic companies, this episode has something for everyone.Thanks to our annual partner IDFC First Bank and Sponsor Ultrahuman for making this episode possible.[00:00:00] Mukund Rajan: Mr. Tata ended up writing a letter which I have seen. He hand-wrote this letter to Prime Minister Vajpayee. It’s probably the fiercest condemnation of government policy that you would see from a corporate leader to the head of government in India. He was very keen to see whether this convergence of IT, communications, hardware, software, all of which is frankly supporting today’s, emergence of broadband, artificial intelligence, all the new applications that ride on the infrastructure.He would have loved to see that combination. Therefore, the one business I can tell you, he was most disappointed about was the fact that our telecoms business didn’t do well. Question the unquestioned, never accept somebody’s negativity, never accept that something can’t be done until you’ve actually given it a damn good shot and quite often you’ll find that it can happen.

For our younger viewers, who may not be aware, the Tatas are the OG Indian business house when it comes to building enduring global businesses from India.Tata group companies with a considerable global footprint include TCS, Tata Motors, Tata Communications, and the Indian Hotel Company.

We’re witnessing a seismic shift as the world races to decarbonize, electrify, and supercharge infrastructure. The global population is rising, but more importantly, so are our living standards, both of which fuel this energy demand growth. But the primary drivers, and the major load additions to the grid will be through AI data centers, electrification of everything, and the relentless march of industrialization across markets is also driving this increase. But let’s be real, energy demand has always ridden the waves of globalization, tech booms and industrial surges. Today, it is the clean energy transition, and aftershocks of the pandemic are rewriting the playbook. Despite decades of climate pledges, fossil fuels still dominate the energy mix. The pressure to decarbonize isn’t just a talking point, it’s an existential imperative. Nuclear energy is a force multiplier here, but nuclear’s global share is still criminally underplayed at just 5 – 6%, shackled by hefty upfront costs and outdated public fears. This trend has taken a U‑turn in recent years with the greatest number of innovations and investments happening. This moment is turbocharged by a two-pronged tech arsenal, fission and fusion.Fission is the workhorse which splits uranium-235 to unleash clean, reliable energy. Sure, it’s got baggage (waste and perception), but it’s proven and indispensable. Fusion, though? That’s the moonshot. Imagine nearly limitless energy, 4x the punch per kilogram compared to fission with no long-lived radioactive waste, and fuel that’s everywhere. The catch? We’re still cracking the code on sustained net energy gain. But with recent breakthroughs lighting up both magnetic and inertial confinement fusion, and a tidal wave of capital flooding in, the fusion future is closer than ever. Resource Click here for the full report! Document The world stands at a pivotal moment as energy demand accelerates, driven by the proliferation of AI powered data centers, electrification of transport and industry, and rapid industrialization in emerging economies. By 2030, global energy consumption is projected to surge by 14% compared to 2024, with developing countries leading this growth. Each exajoule consumed is equivalent to 24 million tons of oil. The scale of the challenge is humongous and so is the urgency for scalable, low-carbon solutions. Global energy consumption rises, but so does CO₂ emissions, underscoring the scale of the decarbonization challenge. Despite decades of climate action, fossil fuels still account for a staggering 81% of global energy use, as shown in the donut chart. Coal, oil, and natural gas continue to dominate, while clean fuels including nuclear, hydro, and other renewables make up less than a fifth of the mix. This heavy reliance on carbon intensive sources is the primary driver of rising emissions.The bar chart on the right tracks annual CO₂ emission growth rates, highlighting the pandemic’s temporary dip in 2020, followed by a sharp rebound in 2021 as economies reopened. While recent years show a slowdown in emission growth, this is largely due to aggressive governmental policies and investments in clean energy, rather than a fundamental shift in the energy system. The reality is, to keep global warming below 1.5°C, we must achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, meaning every ton of CO₂ from fossil fuels must be offset or eliminated. All in all, incremental progress is not enough, a systemic transformation is essential, and the window to act is narrowing. The reliability of nuclear power is gaining recognition among technology giants. As AI and data center energy demands are projected to increase 5x by 2035, companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are making strategic bets on nuclear to ensure continuous, low-carbon power for digital infrastructure, something renewables alone cannot guarantee. Today, nuclear fission provides about 25% of the world’s low-carbon electricity, serving as a backbone for reliable, large-scale power generation. Fission works by splitting heavy atomic nuclei, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239 releasing approximately 200 MeV (million electron volts) of energy per fission event. This immense energy density means that just 1 gram of uranium can produce about 1 megawatt-day of energy, equivalent to burning 3 tons of coal or 600 gallons of fuel oil. In practical terms, the energy density of fission fuels is about one million times greater than fossil fuels.Howeve...",Not found

Founder Joe Kudla’s passion for producing quality goods and building a brand that resonates with customers’ love for an active life produced a company that was profitable from the start. Though not in need of operating capital, Kudla took a growth equity investment from Norwest Venture Partners, which primarily provided liquidity to some early investors and gave him an independent thought partner to help navigate the challenges of rapid growth. Throughout his life, Joe Kudla has pursued excellence in everything he has done, even when that drive required extra effort and raised the kind of doubts that inevitably come from trying new things. A self-described jock in high school and college, he admits he was never the most gifted player, “but I always worked the hardest.” After a stint as a model for top apparel brands in Italy, he became a CPA and then started a successful financial and IT consulting firm. The discipline and dedication required in sports led him toward entrepreneurship, where he felt confident in his ability to build teams and plot winning strategies. But despite achieving plenty of business success, he felt something was missing. “It just wasn’t my passion; my creative side wasn’t being expressed.” A light-bulb moment came during a yoga class where he saw other men who shared his passion for a lifestyle that paired intense physical activity with a positive view of the world. “I wanted to create a brand that aligned with guys into like-minded interests and outlooks.” The result was Vuori. Vuori is the Finnish word for “mountain” – reflecting yet another of Kudla’s passions, mountain climbing. A Change of Heart About Outside Investors The company enjoyed immediate success through a combination of sales through its flagship retail store in Encinitas, CA (famed for its surfing and laid-back lifestyle), direct-to-consumer sales, and limited wholesaling. Funding came from Kudla’s savings and help from friends. Institutional investors were never on the founder’s radar, until he finally accepted an invitation to meet with Jon Kossow, a managing partner at Norwest. Vuori Founder and CEO Joe Kudla Kossow’s growth equity team focuses on private, profitable, fast-growing companies that don’t lack for capital. He jokes, “we try to sell money to people who don’t need it.” Kossow’s message to Kudla was simple: continued growth will bring more and different challenges, and a collaborative partner like Norwest can help you anticipate and mitigate those challenges. In addition, an infusion of capital could provide some liquidity to early angel investors. After Norwest purchased a minority interest in Vuori in late 2019, Kossow joined the board as the first outsider and pursued Norwest’s signature “invited guest” approach to supporting portfolio companies: “We want to be both a proactive and a reactive partner to help with any challenges the management team may have. When you have an issue, reach out to us. Otherwise, concentrate on running your business.” Norwest has helped Vuori with pressing issues such as recruitment and compensation and was actively involved in determining a strategy to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, which included early closure of retail stores and a pivot to large (and successful) online efforts to attract customers. Norwest also helped refine the company’s omnichannel distribution strategy, which includes calibrated allotments of products to wholesale partners as well as firm guidelines on pricing. Kossow is impressed by what Kudla and his team have achieved – but not surprised. “The biggest element that attracted us to Vuori was Joe’s background. I doubt there’s any leader in the appar...",Not found

Team Portfolio News Contact Evolution of IAM: How Identity Fabric Can Streamline Identity Controls and Management 01 . 14 . 2025 By Yoni Greifman and Sunil N Kurkure In our remotely connected world, identity and access management (IAM) has become a fundamental security issue. With the traditional corporate network perimeter rendered obsolete, IAM can combine context, continuity and consistency to provide a complete understanding of the identity of the user and the device, enabling secure and reliable access by establishing explicit trust in a zero-trust world. As classic and GenAI technologies continue to grow, new opportunities and threats will drive IAM’s transformation. Traditional IAM models rely on a perimeter-centric corporate network, managing the identities of users and machines across an increasing list of applications and services in hybrid and multi-cloud environments. These models are not sustainable. Organizations must advance and modify their IAM from a set of discrete tools and processes that manage users and entitlements toward a highly resilient, integrated identity that is secure, interoperable and distributed. Identity-first security marks a fundamental shift from the reliance on static perimeter-based controls that have become obsolete due to the decentralization of computing resources, channels, entities and devices. It underscores the need for more visibility and control in IAM execution. It also allows enterprises to achieve better security for IAM infrastructure and services based on the identity-first security principles of continuous, consistent and contextual. Orchid Security is building identity infrastructure-as-a-service, offering visibility into the identity posture of enterprise applications, and retrofitting or onboarding the applications to centralized access (e.g. Microsoft Entra, Okta, Ping) and governance systems (e.g. SailPoint/Saviynt). The company's platform creates a comprehensive identity fabric that facilitates identity control to standardize the authentication and authorization processes, provides centralized visibility and policy definition, and simplifies the orchestration of recipes and easy codeless remediation across applications. Its solution dynamically refines the sequence of prompt queries to engage with one or more pre-trained large language models (LLMs), based on the extracted code samples and artifacts. The recent developments of LLM have enabled Orchid Security to scale its solution across the enterprise. We first met Orchid Security’s founders Roy Katmor, Ido Kelson and Robert Wiseman in early 2024 and were impressed with the team’s ability to provide an impactful solution that addressed a crucial gap in the market. At the time, existing products and processes were taking months to deploy, holding companies back from fully integrating applications into their identity program. Orchid Security’s straightforward deployment was much needed. Its solution continuously identifies, assesses and retrofits an application’s identity controls to enable personalized digital experiences and meet compliance requirements, overcoming inherent integrations or legacy control flaws. Customers no longer need to deal with lengthy and costly Access Management and IGA deployments involving app refactoring. Orchid Security ensures seamless and swift identity stack integration – without the need for coding or cumbersome manual processes. We are excited to co-lead, together with Team8, the Series Seed announced today and looking forward to working with Orchid Security as they enable businesses to streamline their IAM process and help companies to consume, retrofit, and manage modern identity solutions and controls.

Kissht’s loan book grew from ₹1,268 crore in FY23 to over ₹4,000 crore in FY25, reflecting its ability to scale at speed while maintaining a strong focus on customer experience, compliance, and risk discipline. The platform has over 53 million registered users and has given loans to over 9.2 million till March 2025 across India.. This wide footprint demonstrates Kissht’s ability to take credit access closer to India’s next billion consumers.

Its technology-led approach, powered by proprietary AI and machine learning models, has enabled real-time credit decisioning and improved risk prediction, helping expand financial access even for new-to-credit users.

Over the past two years, search has shifted: now, you go to Google or SearchGPT and get ten paragraphs. However, a bigger shift is occurring in search that’s less noticeable. It doesn’t involve products from specific companies, like Google or OpenAI; in fact, that’s exactly the point. Search is no longer a product you go to. Search is instead becoming internet infrastructure, embedded within millions of products without you even knowing. From product to infrastructure It should come as no surprise that AI is eating software. We believe that design tools like Figma, coding tools like Cursor, and knowledge management tools like Notion are no longer static tools you tell what to do, now they talk back. The world will soon be filled with intelligent products that you can chat with. As intelligence is embedded into every product, so too will search. That’s because AIs need to search. They can’t memorize all the world’s information. They are too small and static, while the world’s information is immense and ever-changing. LLMs need tools that can search over the world’s information. LLMs need search engines. Companies are at different stages of integrating search into their AI products. We believe Cursor and Notion are early. Others will follow. Eventually, most software products will have search embedded inside them, and we’ll soon reach a day when more searches happen outside traditional search engines than within them. A new world of needs When search becomes infrastructure, many changes follow. Here are three: Fragmentation. Every product will have its own search and, therefore, its own specialized search needs. Some will want fast search, others would rather have higher quality. Some want fun results, others want serious ones. Search tools will fragment and specialize to satisfy the varying search needs. New revenue models. Traditional engines monetize clicks; embedded search monetizes outcomes. That shifts power to pure‑play search providers that sell retrieval‑as‑a‑service. Retrieval quality becomes the differentiator. Agents care about recall, latency, and structured entities, not ad-filled results or SEO clickbait. It seems every software company has an AI strategy these days. They will soon need a search strategy too. Opportunity #1: Web search for LLMs LLMs need a live index of the public web, i.e., they need web search. It needs to be accessible via API. That’s what companies like Exa are building. They built a search engine from scratch that we believe is optimized for AIs. When AIs are the end-users, all aspects of search — crawling, embedding models, and interfaces — need to be rethought for optimal downstream LLM performance. Addressable market? Every product that uses LLMs. Pricing? Usage‑based, not ad auctions. Benefit? LLMs get high-quality, real-time knowledge. Opportunity #2: Deep research for humans LLMs enable deep research for humans that goes far beyond the traditional search engine’s half-second results. We believe that OpenAI’s deep research proves the appetite. We also believe that Exa’s Websets play here by unleashing an army of agents to provide a comprehensive set of information for the hardest searches. Both are now available as an API to power new search products that are OK with long-running jobs. Addressable market? Hundreds of millions of knowledge workers. Pricing? Subscriptions, monetizing saved hours rather than clicks. Benefit? 10x reduction in research time. Opportunity #3: Private data search for LLMs Some corporate knowledge is locked behind SaaS silos, like Slack, Drive, and Salesforce. A security‑aware retrieval layer, combined with a chat interface, surfaces it intelligently and instantly. We believe that Glean’s momentum ($7.2 B valuation, June 2025) shows the scale. Addressable market? The $400 B+ enterprise productivity stack — every employee who asks, “where’s that doc?”. Pricing? Per‑seat SaaS with natural upsell to workflow automation and agent workloads. Benefit? Employee productivity and preserving institutional memory. How we think the dust will settle Search APIs win big: The most valuable search companies may never display a results page. Instead, they’ll be an invisible infrastructure layer powering a new world of agents. Fragmented search ecosystem: Expect many winners. API search infra companies power millions of products in the background. Chat apps are the frontend layer for most knowledge workers. And, we think Google continues to lead free, ad‑driven consumer search. A more informed world: Search is embedded into every app, every agent, every context window.

He was an entrepreneur first, founding the Duty Free Shopper business and growing it into a global phenomenon. As Chuck’s business gained momentum, so did his interest in investing in new ideas, people, and philanthropic endeavors. This was the beginning of what would become one of the world’s most remarkable stories in business and philanthropy. In the spring of 1980, Chuck established a direct investment entity. The founding team at General Atlantic would help entrepreneurs build great companies as a means of magnifying Chuck’s ability to contribute to the societal causes that propel global progress. The success would fuel the impact of Atlantic Philanthropies, Chuck’s foundation that made “big bets for a better world.” Hokusai’s print “The Great Wave of Kanagawa” was the inspiration for General Atlantic’s first logo, chosen to represent depth, dynamism and transformational change. Chuck was General Atlantic’s sole investor in the firm for more than a decade. Chuck gave our founding team the latitude to think outside of the box, follow their instincts, and take an untraditional approach to what was an unprecedented investment mandate. This team saw an opportunity to build a new kind of firm, focused on patient capital and partnership with purpose—laying the foundations for our Growth Equity strategy. “There was a spirit of working together in that building and being part of a team of people that was always going to back you up. It cannot be overstated how important that was to our early success and how much that translated to the entrepreneurs we invested in.” – Dave Hodgson, General Atlantic Vice Chairman From our first office, a brownstone in midtown Manhattan, we have grown into one of the world’s leading investors in growth and innovation, with a committed team of over 950 employees across 29 locations. Our culture and founding values fuel our strategy to this day: relentlessly focused on what’s coming next as we build resilient investment portfolios, partner collaboratively alongside some of the world’s most visionary leaders, thoughtfully manage our clients’ legacies, and create value within businesses, sectors and communities. Our work and our team have evolved – pioneering in new markets and new strategies across our Growth Equity, Climate, Credit and Sustainable Infrastructure businesses. And our driving purpose remains the same. Everything we do is designed to our empower our capital partners, our people and our companies. This means investing in and powering the growth of companies whose sense of purpose and focus on the long term align with our own. It means balancing and serving the needs of our partners, and building durable strategies for the future. We were founded with a lofty goal, and in the past four and a half decades, we have only strengthened our resolve, growing and evolving to better deliver on our guiding purpose. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 1980 General Atlantic was founded as a family office for entrepreneur and philanthropist, Chuck Feeney.

Outline Loading the Elevenlabs Text to Speech AudioNative Player... Gloria Lin went on a lot of dates in 2019. No, not that kind. We’re talking about co-founder dating.As the first head of product at Flipboard and the first PM hire at Stripe, Lin’s seen founding teams in action — and knew what she was looking for as she set out to build a company of her own. “I always wanted to team up with someone. My experiences as a product leader were strongest when I was partnering closely with an engineering leader,” says Lin. “When I left to start a company, there were a few spaces I was interested in, but I didn’t have a specific startup idea so I set my sights on finding a strong co-founder to work with.” But she quickly found that was easier said than done. “Most of the co-founder stories I’d heard fell in this bucket of former co-workers pairing up to go after an idea. But it’s not that simple. You have to both want to do a startup — requiring similar levels of high-risk tolerance — and be available at the same time, which depends on life and financial circumstances. And once you step outside of that pool, it gets harder to meet someone,” says Lin. “I knew I didn’t want my search to be random or unfocused, so I honed my process and took my time. I ended up ‘dating’ six different potential co-founders over the course of a year. Just like real-life dating, sometimes it seemed like I was going to end up alone. Eventually, I met Joel Poloney and everything clicked. Now we’re working on Siteline together.”As the next generation of company builders takes shape and new founder mafias spin out of places like Stripe, it stands to reason that more co-founder stories won’t fit the traditional mold, and will instead look a lot more like Lin’s. And judging from threads on Reddit, countless questions on Quora, and all the “first dates” filling up coffee shops in SOMA, the carefully designed hunt for a co-founder is already afoot.While the Review has covered co-founder considerations before, from getting vulnerable about painful “divorces” to applying a framework for strategically assembling a founding team, we’ve never seen a process like Lin’s. It’s a detailed, step-by-step playbook for thinking through all the potential pitfalls that can ruin even the best of co-founder relationships.In this exclusive interview, Lin presents that rigorous approach in full, from how she found potential partners and handled early conversations to how they ideated and prototyped together to narrow in on a more specific idea. Whether you’re a proven founder working on your next play or a wannabe entrepreneur waiting in the wings, her process can add a dose of rigor to your own search for a co-founder.Lin also shares the incredibly detailed co-founder questionnaire — with 50 questions spanning across six categories — that she and other fellow founders have collaborated on to probe compatibility more deeply. We’ll highlight a handful of impactful questions here in this article, tacking on Lin’s marginalia: her reflections on why these questions stood out, the sticking points you need to watch for, and how you’ll know when you’ve found “the one.”But we've also included the full set (below, in a designed PDF template so you can grab and go, and further down in a Google Doc, in case you'd like to edit and add your own questions).Want to jump straight into the set of 50 questions to ask a potential co-founder? 50 Questions for Interviewing a Potential Co-Founder Download PDF BEFORE YOU GET STARTED: COMMON ADVICE WITH SOME CAVEATSThe search for a co-founder often conjures up comparisons to dating. It’s become a well-worn metaphor because from fights to marriage to divorce, parallels abound.“Finding a co-founder can feel like a more intense version of dating. One key difference though is that most people have at least some experience with real-life dating. And there’s certainly tons of self-help books for tips as well as apps that make it easier to meet people. But when it comes to figuring out how to find a co-founder, it’s hard to know where to begin,” says Lin.“That’s a huge problem because two of the most common causes of startup failures are not finding product/market fit and co-founder issues. The former is top of mind for every budding entrepreneur, but I don’t think people consider the latter as much when they’re crafting their pitches,"" she says.

But when it comes to sales-led B2B startups, we’ve reverse engineered a method to increase the odds of unlocking it.We’ve worked with some of the world’s most iconic enterprise founders and distilled what they did in their first six months into a series of tactical sessions for taking a straighter path to PMF. Today, we’re open sourcing the first session, which shares how we’ve broken PMF down to an incredibly granular level in order to help more builders get there faster.Even though finding product-market fit is the single most important objective any company must achieve, it’s still a black box for founders — seemingly requiring some mysterious combination of luck, market timing, and sheer grit.While much has been written on the topic, no one has broken down the inputs, leading indicators and tactical steps that could increase the odds of finding PMF. In our view, one of the key reasons this topic hasn’t been successfully “framework-ified” is that most folks still talk about the concept in generalities.Fish are jumping into the boat. Leads are falling on the floor. You’re chasing — not pushing — a boulder. The product is being pulled out of your hands. You’ll know it when you see it. You can feel when it’s not happening. These descriptions lack the specificity that we see in other areas of company building.Another issue? Most resources target a wide range of builders — which results in watered-down advice that’s more hand-wavy than tactical. Founders are left with approaches that are neither replicable nor practical, ranging from unhelpful “We kind of just started going viral” founding stories to one-size-fits-all frameworks that don’t address the nuances of their specific business.While the hunt for PMF can be more of a dice game with poor odds for, say, consumer apps, our experience has taught us that for sales-led B2B companies, you can reduce the role of luck.Here’s how we’ve developed that conviction: As a firm of former founders and startup builders, we’re coming up on our 20th year of investing in pre-product-market fit startups. Along with Square, Notion, Looker, and Verkada, we’ve backed hundreds of companies when they were just a couple of founders and an idea.Drawing on our own data and observations from more than 500 investments, we’ve spent the last several years breaking down the decade-long project of building a category-defining B2B company into more concrete steps — in hopes that we could create this resource that we feel is missing from the ecosystem.To put it even more plainly: Despite all the talk about product-market fit, it didn’t seem like anyone was meaningfully putting the pieces together to help B2B founders increase their odds of finding it. We wanted to change that.In addition to distilling lessons from decades of our own experience, we’ve layered on hundreds of hours of research and interviewed dozens of founders who’ve gotten further on this journey than most, from both within and outside of our community. (If you’re a regular reader of The Review, you may have noticed that we’ve started publishing some of these stories in our series Paths to PMF — focusing on the down-in-the-weeds details of how companies from Vanta to Vercel took off.)As the culmination of that work, today we’re proud to unveil Product-Market Fit Method, an intensive 14-week experience designed to help exceptional pre-seed founders build epic B2B SaaS companies. From proven tactics to detailed benchmarks that help founders gauge progress, we’ve mined the secrets that are buried in the best B2B builders’ experiences to create a new methodology that helps startups take a straighter path to PMF.The program (which can be applied for here) consists of eight tactical sessions.

It doesn’t mean you charge single-minded toward a goal. It means you pay rapt and incremental attention to how you need to turn the rudder on a project.” – Fidji Simo“It’s essential to grow with the company — rather than having the company grow around you.” – Cristina Cordova “You have to be impatient with shipping, but patient with your career.” – James Everingham“‘I trust you, make the call’ might be the six most powerful words you can hear from a manager.” – Sean Twersky“Your job as a CEO is to build fire departments, not put out fires.” – Sam Corcos “Can you say with confidence that each report would want to be on your team again? If you aren’t sure that the answer is yes, it’s probably no — much like how if you have to ask, ‘Am I in love?’ you’re probably not.” – Julie Zhuo “People can get addicted to yak shaving. An effective engineering generalist knows when to move on. Pay attention to whether they used their time wisely, not just the results.” – Mike Krieger “It sounds so simple to say that bosses need to tell employees when they're screwing up. But it very rarely happens.” – Kim Scott“You’ll know you understand the customer problem enough when you can predict 75% of what a customer tells you. Keep having these conversations until three-quarters of it is stuff you already know.” – Christina Cacioppo“I have a rule: no company swag until the business has at least $250K of revenue or 250k users. Until then, you don’t get to “feel” the benefits of having started a company.” – Gagan Biyani“The business model ends up becoming the business. It’s equally important as the market you’re going after and the product that you build.” – Jay Simons “If speed is the yin, the yang is prioritization. You can’t be fast if you don’t know what’s important.” – Jaleh Rezaei“If you treat your connections as a kind of personal ATM you use for frequent withdrawals, you’ll quickly be disappointed (and overdrawn).” – Karen Wickre “Delighting the customer always yields better returns than countering or copying a competitor. It’s just a lot harder to do.” – Andy Rachleff “When you’re a founder, every moment you’re not writing code or getting users, you need to be making a conscious choice: Is whatever you’re doing worth your time?” – Alexis Ohanian“‘Why would a customer not want this?’ is often a far more interesting question than why they would.” – Rick Song“When you leave the planning process wondering if you put too many resources behind a single bet, that’s the bet that ends up succeeding. Bold ideas need bold resourcing.” – Lenny Rachitsky and Nels Gilbreth“Treat customer development as a one-on-one with a direct report — you just want to ask the hard questions.” – Ryan Glasgow","Levels of PMF | First RoundIntroducing Applied Intelligence, a new publication dedicated to AI actually working in productionRead moreHomeCompaniesHow we workTeamWho we backPMF MethodThe ReviewSESSION 01Levels of PMFProduct-Market Fit isn’t a black box — a new framework to help B2B founders find it, faster4.8.2024Back to PMF MethodSESSION 01Levels of PMFIntroLevels of PMFLevel 1NascentLevel 2DevelopingLevel 3StrongLevel 4ExtremeMost people describe finding product-market fit as an art, not a science.

Karen King, a deeply respected Silver Lake executive who joined the firm over 21 years ago and has served as Managing Director & Chief Legal Officer since 2010, has been promoted to the newly created business role of Managing Director & Chief Operating Officer. Justin Hamill, who has served as esteemed outside counsel to Silver Lake for over a decade, will be joining the firm to become its Managing Director & Chief Legal Officer. In her new role, King will formally assume the expanded leadership responsibilities she has taken on in key areas over the last several years. In addition to partnering with Hamill as he leads the global Legal & Compliance function, she will continue to provide oversight of the Human Resources, Government Affairs and Investor Relations functions. King will be positioned to engage more deeply in her current service on the boards of some of Silver Lake’s largest portfolio companies, such as Relativity and Qualtrics, as well as the board of Endeavor, which she joined recently. Previously, she represented Silver Lake on the boards of Serena Software and Aras. Building on that experience and leveraging a long career of transaction execution, King will devote increasingly more time to investment activities. Hamill joins Silver Lake from his role as Global Chair of M&A for the global law firm Latham & Watkins, where he was twice named The American Lawyer’s “Dealmaker of the Year.” Over the last decade, he has advised Silver Lake on more transactions than any other outside counsel, including most recently its investments in Vantage, Khazna and ProService as well as the carveouts of Qualtrics from SAP and Altera from Intel. “At Silver Lake, we strive for exceptionalism in our talent. We are thrilled to congratulate Karen, our extraordinary partner and consigliere, on this well-earned promotion, and to have Justin, an elite legal mind and sage advisor, joining our senior leadership team,” said co-CEOs Egon Durban and Greg Mondre. “The depth of both of their experience and wisdom will be instrumental as we continue to grow our platform and pursue our investment strategies.” Silver Lake would also like to take this opportunity to recognize a cherished long-standing contributor who is retiring from the firm to spend more time with his family. After 17 years at Silver Lake, Andy Schader, the firm’s vaunted General Counsel, will transition to an Of Counsel role at the end of next month. “We are extremely grateful to Andy for his many years of dedication and innumerable contributions to the firm, and we wish him all the best in his well-earned next chapter,” said Durban and Mondre. About Silver Lake Silver Lake is a global technology investment firm, with approximately $104 billion in combined assets under management and committed capital and a team of professionals based in North America, Europe and Asia.

Why do enterprises still rely on IT services in the AI era? What structural constraints hinder traditional IT players from becoming fully AI-native? Three types of fast-moving AI-first challengers that will disrupt existing models The future of AI-enabled IT — and what this means for founders Our investment thesis Contributors Nithin Kaimal Pankaj Mitra Aparna Chaganty Priya Kale Shrey Agarwal Share Subscribe Email (required): Do not fill in (spam control): 10.28.25 India AI & ML Roadmap: Reinventing IT services in the age of AI As one of the largest exporters of IT services globally, India’s largest incumbents face a once-in-a-generation disruption from the rise of LLMs. India’s $264 billion IT sector has long been the world’s technology backbone, powering enterprises across the US, Europe, and beyond. The industry’s success was built on scale, skilled talent, and cost efficiency, reinforced by decades of experience serving Fortune 500 clients. The rise of LLMs and AI marks a once-in-a-generation inflection point. The people- and process-driven model that defined traditional outsourcing is being rewritten by automation, intelligence, and data-native workflows. This disruption is generating a new wave of AI-first challengers — nimble startups reimagining legacy services with smarter, faster, and more adaptive solutions. This roadmap explores how AI is reshaping the foundation of India’s IT industry. Specifically, where incumbents must evolve, how new business models are emerging, and why this transformation could redefine the global outsourcing playbook for the decade ahead. Key insights on reinventing IT services in the age of AI India has an enduring edge in IT services. This is anchored in talent, global client trust, and cost efficiency. However, AI makes deep strategic pivots crucial to stay competitive. AI is automating what people once powered, disrupting the billable-hour model that defines traditional IT services. Incumbents are adapting, but not as quickly as AI upstarts. Legacy structures and limited R&D leave room for agile, AI-native challengers to seize market share. Three new business models are emerging: AI-enabled services, services built for AI, and pure software-led platforms. Despite short-term price compression, AI is expanding the total outsourcing opportunity. With global demand for AI-driven solutions accelerating, we expect India’s IT sector to reach $400B by 2030, led by firms delivering domain-specific automation that outperforms traditional service models on speed, quality, and cost. Full slide deck Roadmap: Reinventing IT services in the age of AI How is AI disrupting the Indian IT industry? Before the current wave of AI-native disruption, India’s IT services giants had perfected a powerful operating playbook built on three pillars: 1. A vast and skilled talent pool 2. Strong cost arbitrage 3. The ‘follow-the-sun delivery’ model This model draws its strength from India’s advantage in cultivating a highly skilled and diverse talent ecosystem. The country produces roughly 2.6 million STEM graduates every year, more than triple the number of people in other leading nations, forming a deep bench of engineering experts who are fluent in English, coding, and quantitative reasoning. In addition, there’s a cost advantage to working with people in India, considering the median engineering salaries are well below those in other leading economies. These levers have fueled sustained growth. Over the past decade, the combined market capitalization of India’s top ten IT services firms has more than doubled from $166 billion to $354 billion-underpinned by more than 7% annual revenue growth to nearly $90 billion.1 1. Data in this report has been generated through BVP research based on figures from company and industry reports But AI is now rewriting the rules. Technologies such as transformer architectures and large language models (LLMs) are fundamentally changing how information is processed, tasks are executed, and value is delivered. What was once a people-centric delivery model is giving way to automation-driven intelligence. Cloud-hosted and open-source AI models are further lowering the cost and barriers to deploying sophisticated capabilities, reducing the need for massive, pyramid-shaped workforces. AI’s ability to process vast datasets, extract hidden insights, and accelerate time-to-value is reshaping client expectations and compressing delivery cycles. Firms like Graph AI illustrate this shift, for instance, by automating complex pharmacovigilance workflows by parsing hundreds of thousands of adverse drug event reports, evaluating causal links between drugs and patient symptoms, recommending remediation actions for human medical reviewers, and generating compliance-ready submissions for regulators. AI doesn’t just improve traditional IT services — it redefines the...",,"Eric Baker: Why being thrown out of offices may mean you're onto something huge - Bessemer Venture Partners Skip To Content Toggle menu Team Companies RoadmapsClose Sub Nav AI & ML Biotech Cloud Consumer Cybersecurity Crypto Data Deep tech Developer Fintech Healthcare Marketplaces Vertical software Seed DiscoverClose Sub Nav About Philosophy Memos Anti-Portfolio Contact Insights Atlas News AI insights Heart of Healthcare Resources Cloud Index STRIVE Portfolio careers Subscribe Global Europe Israel Funds Flagship Growth India BVP Forge Subscribe Listen on Google Podcasts Apple Podcasts Amazon Music Spotify Stitcher Castbox Pandora iHeartRadio Share Subscribe Email (required): Do not fill in (spam control): 11.28.22 Podcast Eric Baker: Why being thrown out of offices may mean you're onto something huge As the founder of the event ticketing giants StubHub and Viagogo, Eric Baker sent shockwaves across the tech industry after being ousted from StubHub, but then later acquiring it once more with a $4.05 billion cash buyout. It took nearly two decades, but Eric is finally getting the final word on his full circle journey. Guest Eric BakerStubHub and Viagogo Eric Baker is the co-founder of StubHub, the American ticket exchange and resale company that he founded in 2000 as part of a Stanford competition, and is also the founder and CEO of Viagogo, the multinational ticket exchange and ticket resale company that Eric founded in 2006 after StubHub was acequired by eBay. Four lessons from Eric Baker’s unlikely journey from co-founding CEO of StubHub to competitor to CEO again Eric Baker shares StubHub’s unique founding, break-up, and reunification story—as well as the leadership lessons he learned along the way. “It was the spring of 1999 and I was working at Bain Capital,” recalls Eric Baker, co-founder of StubHub and founder and CEO of Viagogo. “My girlfriend at the time wanted to go see the opening of the Lion King. In those days, you had to wander around Times Square or pay a ticket broker out the nose. And at the same time, the internet was taking off with sites like eBay. I thought to myself, ‘Gosh, there's gotta be a better way for the resale of tickets.’” So began Eric’s epic journey into entrepreneurship—one that involved economic turmoil, a co-founder rift, a $4.05 billion buyout, and ultimately, redemption. We sat down with Eric and he shared wisdom from his experience with a downturn during the dot com bust, how to grow and be profitable at the same time, and how pattern recognition can help you stay calm amidst a crisis. Downturns may contain unexpected advantages Raising capital did not come easy to Eric. When he pitched Fred Rosen—who served as CEO of Ticketmaster until 1998—Fred told him, “‘Eric, all you need to know are four words: It will never happen.” And Fred was not the only naysayer he encountered. “I was thrown out of the NFL offices. I was thrown out of team offices,” recalls Eric. “There was a widespread attitude of, ‘Scalping is terrible. We don't wanna be involved with it.’” But an even bigger obstacle presented itself when in 2000, the dot com bubble burst and NASDAQ crashed. All of a sudden, nobody wanted to touch anything that was related to the internet. “A lot of people said, ‘Why are you doing this internet thing? It doesn't make any sense,’” says Eric. But this widespread wariness towards online businesses carried unexpected benefits. “It was definitely a time where you had to really believe in your mission,” says Eric. “You had to push to persevere. Those who were trying to make a quick buck or jump on the bandwagon were quickly washed out.” Today, Eric attributes much of StubHub’s success to coming up in this milieu. “A lot of great companies were created in that environment because it drove down the cost of labor. Stupid competitors went away and many of us got a real opportunity to build a lasting business after getting through that dip.” Have a contingency plan for ruptures in the co-founder relationship Nobody wants to imagine that their relationship with their cofounder will go sour. But it happens. By 2003, StubHub was seeing big successes. But all was not well on the leadership team. Eric had always focused on external aspects of the business like fundraising and his co-founder Jeff Fluhr managed the internal operations. One day, the two had a difference of opinion. “He said to me, ‘Look if you don't like it, you can quit.’ And I said, ‘Screw you, you can fire me.’ I had no employment contract to protect. And shockingly, a short time later, I was told, ‘Hey, you're fired.’” With all of the risks and challenges Eric knew he was signing up for as a co-founder, he never anticipated the conflict with his co-founder would be one of them. “I structured things so that the majority of founders' stock would control the board,” he says. “I thought that would protect the founders from the external investors if there were issues. I never really thought through what happens if I have an ...",,Not found

Hosted by Insight Partners’ Emmanuelle Skala with Diligent's Linda Campbell Cook, the session focused on how customer success, professional services, and support teams plan for growth and efficiency within the same cost envelope. We covered: 🏒 Building annual plans that tie GRR, NRR, and GDR goals to detailed assumptions — renewal volume, product mix, churn drivers, and adoption trends — before budgeting headcount or spend. 🏒 Using a two-track planning model that connects the top-line track (bookings and growth) with the expense track (margin and efficiency), ensuring both targets move in sync. 🏒 Designing cost models that separate gross margin (COGS) from EBITDA margin (OPEX), so leaders understand exactly where post-sales teams influence profitability. 🏒 Standardizing onboarding, renewals, and support workflows to create the foundation for automation and AI-driven productivity improvements in 2026. 🏒 Introducing capacity plans that balance onshore, offshore, and partner resources to meet utilization and deployment goals while improving service delivery. 🏒 Embedding efficiency initiatives into the plan — from self-service adoption to AI-assisted triage and case deflection — and quantifying the margin impact of each. 🏒 Aligning quarterly planning with product and sales, so resource allocation reflects roadmap timing, customer complexity, and the true cost of serving each segment. Disciplined, data-driven planning turns customer success into the company’s most reliable growth system — converting what was once a reactive function into a consistent source of revenue expansion. We’ve got 3.5K+ open customer success roles across the Insight portfolio – join a team where CS isn’t an afterthought, but a revenue-driving, cross-functional powerhouse: https://lnkd.in/ePP_avU8 13 Like Comment Share Insight Partners 156,723 followers 1d Edited Report this post At the start of every #ScaleUp journey, we ...",Mission statement not found,Vision statement not found,,,,"Team | Insight Partners JUST RELEASED View The Insight Partners Guide to Raising Capital ACCESS GUIDE NOW close Go to home page main-logo main-logo Why Insight?

Across the US, there have been significant upward revisions to regional power demand forecasts compared to 3-5 years ago (the latest forecast roughly 11x greater or an 8% CAGR).1 Meeting this rising demand will require huge amounts of investment to reinforce and upgrade the country’s aging electrical grid. Utilities are forecasted to invest $1.4T in the grid from 2025 to 2030 alone (equal to ~1.1x the market cap of the sector today).2 Projected Utility Demand Growth in Top Quartile Growth Markets Average Compound Annual Growth Rate Sources: Pre-2024 and latest forecast represents the average of Texas, Northern Indiana, Virginia, Georgia and Arizona. Texas: Texas represents ERCOT summer peak demand CAGR published in ’23 (’23 – ’32) vs. latest forecast as of April 2025 (’25 – ‘31). Northern Indiana: N.

Uses a forecast period of (’23 – ’35) and does not include upside emerging load from data centers in revised case. Georgia: Georgia represents utility Georgia Power’s summer peak demand CAGR published in 2022 (’25 – ’31) vs. latest forecast published in July 2025 (’25 – ’31). Virginia: Virginia represents Dominion PJM 10-Yr summer peak demand CAGR published in ’21 vs. ’25. Arizona: Arizona represents long-term electricity sales forecast of Pinnacle West (NYSE:PNW; fully regulated electric utility serving ~1.4M customers in high-growing cities across Arizona) in ’19 vs. ’25.

Market cap data represents 48 listed US utilities, as of August 13, 2025. July 3, 2025 Private Credit Resilience in Times of Uncertainty In early April, market volatility hit public credit markets hard. High-yield bond spreads widened sharply — one of the most significant moves in history — before recovering ~71% by early May. 1 But private credit markets remained resilient, operating normally. Further, private credit can offer stable cash flows, insulation from certain policy changes and can serve as a valuable tool for portfolio diversification. 2 High-Yield Spreads Gap Out in One of Most Significant Moves in History 8-week Absolute High-Yield Spread Changes (in bps) Source: Bloomberg US Corporate High-Yield Index, as of April 8th, 2025.

Apollo stands as a key financing partner for some of the most innovative sectors driving our future. With the unprecedented need for secular CapEx, today’s high-growth companies are looking beyond traditional funding sources. They’re turning to Apollo’s expansive capital base and flexible solutions to support the long duration capital demands of the new economy. Rising to Meet the Capital Needs of a Renaissance Each century has its story of economic evolution. The 20th century saw unprecedented growth, fueled by railroads, utilities, and the dawn of the automotive industry. At the time, insurance companies were the bedrock of capital, supporting vast infrastructure needs. A century later, we entered a period of great globalization in the markets, driven by deregulation and lower interest rates. This allowed banks and capital markets to play a critical role in funding expansion. Today, we sit on the precipice of a new era — a secular Global Industrial Renaissance. The capital demands of key industries like utilities, digital infrastructure and support for the energy transition are estimated to be between $75-100 trillion. But this time, it’s private capital — nimble, adaptive and forward-looking — that can meet this challenge. Unprecedented Need for Secular CapEx 1. TAMs reflect the views and opinions of Apollo Analysts based on expected aggregate investment/capex demands over the next 10 years. 2. Apollo Chief Economist.

Andreessen Horowitz,https://www.a16z.com/,support@a16z.com,224) 100,"Andreessen Horowitz - Chennai, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","A culture is not a set of beliefs, it’s a set of actions. BUSHIDO Who We Are Our culture is our way of doing things, not just reading about them. And yet, unless we set that culture, it’ll just be what it is without an intentional purpose. We are clear about our beliefs and what we stand for. We define how we treat entrepreneurs, our relationships within our many networks, and each other. And we make explicit our expectations of what it means to be a part of the a16z team, whatever your role. We do only first class business and only in a first class way We take this inspiration from John Pierpont Morgan who built and ran what was one of the first venture capital businesses. For us there are several components to it: We respect the intense struggle of the entrepreneurial process and we know that without the entrepreneurs we have no business. When dealing with entrepreneurs, we always show up on time and we always get back to them timely and with substantive feedback, even if it’s bad news (like a rejection). We have an optimistic view of the future and believe that entrepreneurs, whether they succeed or fail, are working to help us achieve a better future. As a result, we never publicly criticize any entrepreneur or startup (doing so is a fireable offense). This does not mean that we leave CEOs in place forever. Our obligation is to the company not the founder. If the founder is no longer capable of running the company, the founder will not remain as CEO. Our word is our bond. When we make a commitment to a partner, an entrepreneur, a limited partner, or someone in our network, we keep it. Although we have legal agreements, the people who we do business with do not need them, because what we say is what we do. As a result, we do not haphazardly commit the firm. We carefully consider and discuss all important commitments, because we will live up to what we commit. We tell the truth even if it hurts. When talking to an entrepreneur, an LP, a partner, or each other, we strive to tell the truth. We are open and honest. We do not withhold material information or tell half truths. Even if the truth will be difficult to hear or to say, we err on the side of truth in the face of difficult consequences. We do not, however, dwell on trivial truths with the intention of hurting people’s feelings or making them look bad. We tell the truth to make people better not worse. We take a long view of relationships, because we are in the relationship business We build relationships with people we want to do business with for a very long time and we treat them as such. We do not take a transactional view. If we meet an executive, we take an interest in her career and help her find the right job for her. We do not try to jam her into a specific company. If we bring a corporate partner on board, we seek to help them innovate in a way that meets their business needs. We do not try to sell them a product because we have a company that needs to make a quarter. If we invest in an entrepreneur, we don’t just spend time with her when she is a “winner”. We are there in good times and in bad. We can be a tough friend at times, but we are a friend for life. We never compromise long-term trust with any relationship for the sake of a short-term win. However, we expect our partners to be good friends to us and our expectations about what it means to be a friend are high. If our partners do not treat us in kind, we will walk away. We believe in the future and bet the firm that way We are in the business of investing in innovators. This has many implications. First, the nature of the bet is asymmetric. We think far more about how big the outcome will be if a deal succeeds than all the ways that it can fail. We don’t criticize deals that aren’t working, because we know the bet was asymmetric when we made it and the job was dangerous when we took it. Next, we never ridicule or dismiss new ideas that we do not yet understand. If we don’t understand something, we assume that we are the ones who are slow, not the entrepreneur. Finally, we invest in the magnitude of the strength of the idea and the team, not in their lack of weaknesses. We invest in innovators and we too must innovate. Thanks to our entrepreneurs, the world is changing fast and we must continue to change with it. This means being open to new ideas no matter how crazy they sound at the time. Everything we’ve ever invested in sounded crazy at some point — from virtual reality to cryptocurrency to air mattresses in apartments, we know that breakthrough ideas are difficult to recognize at the time and we strive to do just that. In addition, as new technological categories emerge, we will reorganize the firm, change our fund structure, and even revisit our culture to adapt. Innovation is not an excuse to avoid today’s work, nor does it mean that we celebrate failure. We set objectives, we measure ourselves, and we deliver against those commitments. The goal is to win and we will win by be...",Mission statement not found,Vision statement not found,,,,"Team Team We’re a team of operators, creators, and connectors committed to creating new opportunities for those who have directly shaped our culture to have a hand in building the future.

These were smart, motivated engineers who'd joined the company to solve interesting problems. Yet one by one, nearly his entire site reliability team left the company. Engineers ""want to build great things, not be texted at 3 a.m,"" Spiros says. If there was a culprit, it was complexity itself. And in today's AI era, the problem is only getting worse. AI is making it dramatically faster and easier to write code, yet the most difficult and tedious part of engineering work has seen little innovation. ""We're facing a new crisis where we're building faster than we can operate,"" says Spiros. That realization prompted Spiros and his longtime collaborator Mayank Agarwal to start Resolve AI in early 2024. The company is building agentic AI that helps engineering teams with incident resolution and day-to-day production work. Resolve's impact so far? Customers report cutting incident resolution time by 70%+, boosting on-call productivity by 75%, and saving as much as 20 hours per week per engineer. Yet this is just the beginning of a much larger transformation. Spiros envisions a future where engineers can focus entirely on creative work, while AI handles the operational complexity that has consumed so much of their time. “We will produce technology 100x faster,” he says.

Congrats to Braintrust for being listed on the TechCrunch Disrupt top 60 companies shaping AI! My favorite thing about listening to Ankur Goyal talk about evals and building great AI products is he's always pushing for simplicity even as resulting systems are getting more and more capable: “Agents are a very natural evolution of AI software, and AI software is a very natural evolution of software.

Respected as a leader by his peers, Dan Gregory was elected to serve on the National Venture Capital (NVCA) board from 1978 to 1985, to be President from 1983 to 1984, and to be Chairman from 1984 to 1985. In January, 1991, Dan withdrew from Greylock to serve under newly elected Massachusetts Governor William Weld as the Secretary of Economic Affairs. He returned to the firm in May, 1992.

The firm is named after the street where Elfers lived in Wellesley Hills. Having worked for General Georges Doriot at the original venture capital firm, American Research & Development, Elfers went on to create Greylock, an innovative firm that emphasized collegiality and partnership over a more hierarchical approach to running venture investment organizations. “From the beginning, I believed in collegiality,” says Elfers. “That would be a crucial element in selecting and developing the general partners and creating the framework for the firm’s culture.” Over the course of his 50 years in venture capital, Bill led investments in companies such as The Shipley Company, International Equipment Corporation, Teradyne, Dymo Business Systems, BTU International and Damon – and also served on the Board of Directors of ITT, The Hartford, Westvaco and the Sherman Fairchild Foundation.
