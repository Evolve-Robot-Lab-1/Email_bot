With CAIOs taking a strategic seat at the leadership table, Indian enterprises are combining technical depth with executive expertise to accelerate AI adoption. The study finds that 77% of CAIOs in India report strong C-suite support (including 67% reporting CEO support), reflecting strong organizational alignment to scale AI effectively. Furthermore, while 25% of Indian enterprises surveyed currently have a CAIO, 67% of them aim to have one within the next two years, demonstrating India’s growing appetite for aligning a leader to direct AI strategy that drives measurable outcomes. This momentum is backed by impact, as globally organizations with a CAIO see a 10% higher return on investment (ROI) on AI spend, underscoring the value of strong AI leadership and strategic alignment in driving business results. “As Indian enterprises move from pilots to scaled AI adoption, the role of the CAIOs will be central to their AI transformation journeys. CAIOs will not only bridge the gap between business and technology but also set the strategic direction and keep teams aligned on shared goals,” said Viswanath Ramaswamy, Vice President, Technology, IBM India & South Asia. “To succeed, CAIOs must develop a clear transformation roadmap with measurable KPIs, foster alignment with the C-suite on business priorities and focus on initiatives that deliver a sustainable and competitive edge.” Other key findings for India include: Strong C-Suite Support for AI Leadership in India 80% CAIOs are consulted by other CXOs on important AI decisions. 57% of Indian CAIOs were appointed internally, highlighting the development of AI leadership talent from within enterprises. 60% of CAIOs report directly to either the CEO or the Board of Directors. Broader mandates and Implementation Focus Indian CAIOs are taking on comprehensive responsibilities spanning strategy, directing technical implementation, managing budgets and upskilling talent. The study found that the top three responsibilities of Indian CAIOs were, defining the organization’s AI strategy (70%), developing change management strategy for AI adoption (57%), and directing implementation of AI (57%). These figures are, on average, 10 percentage points higher than global respondents, suggesting that Indian CAIOs place greater emphasis on these areas and are scaling AI more rapidly than their global peers. Interestingly, many CAIOs are also overseeing upskilling (43%) and reskilling (37%) of employees in AI. 60% stated that their AI budget is controlled by the CAIO, strengthening accountability. Technical Depth as a Competitive Edge 70% of Indian CAIOs have a background in data, aligned with global counterparts. 73% come from technology roles while 50% have an innovation background, reinforcing their ability to lead transformation agendas. Adoption: From Pilots to Scale While 67% of Indian organizations are still primarily investing in AI pilots, the combination of strong leadership support and CAIOs’ strategic orientation will provide a strong foundation for accelerating scaled AI adoption. Only 18% of Indian CAIOs find AI implementation very difficult (versus 30% globally), reflecting a more optimistic execution environment.

According to Accenture’s State of Cyber Resilience 2025 report, the majority (90%) of organizations are not ready to protect against AI-augmented cyber threats. By combining Accenture’s cybersecurity services, AI transformation expertise and industry experience with Microsoft’s advanced security technologies, the companies are helping organizations protect against advanced threats through innovative cybersecurity offerings across four key areas. These include security operation center (SOC) modernization, automated data and AI security, security-centric cyber migration and consolidation, and enhanced identity and access management (IAM). “Global cyber threats, now leveraging AI, are intensifying in speed, sophistication and scale. By adopting automation and gen AI solutions, organizations can reimagine their SecOps and outpace rising adversarial cyber threats,” said Paolo Dal Cin, global lead, Accenture Security. “The combined power of Accenture and Microsoft will help clients future-proof against potential cyber threats, keep critical data secure and enhance business resilience. This expanded relationship signals to the industry that we can be stronger together.” Accenture and Microsoft successfully completed a project with Nationwide Building Society (Nationwide), the world's largest building society with over 17 million customers in the UK, to build on its cybersecurity operations. Through a large-scale migration to Microsoft Sentinel, Nationwide achieved a streamlined, unified security infrastructure that accelerates cyber threat detection. Nationwide benefited from a gen AI security information and event management capability, co-developed by Accenture and Microsoft, that accelerated the migration of hundreds of terabytes of data. David Boda, chief security & resilience officer at Nationwide, said, “In a dynamic and complex threat environment, it’s important that we continue to build on our existing cybersecurity operations to stay ahead of the game. Accenture’s support in our migration to Microsoft Sentinel has been invaluable to set us up for success. The use of generative AI to enable the migration allowed us to deliver the change more efficiently, in turn freeing up capacity for wider improvement activities.” The solutions Accenture and Microsoft are investing in co-developing include: SOC Modernization – Leveraging Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Defender and Accenture’s Adaptive MxDR for Microsoft, this solution enhances threat visibility and strengthens response capabilities across hybrid environments. By integrating AI-driven tools like Microsoft Security Copilot, analysts can investigate threats faster, cut through alert noise and focus on what matters—reducing risk and improving SOC efficiency among security teams’ limited staff and other resources. With the right combination of automation and intelligent tooling, organizations can boost SOC efficiency by up to 30%[1], according to recent assessments. Automated Data Protection and AI Security – Using Microsoft Purview and Accenture’s data security framework, this solution automatically classifies and protects sensitive data across Microsoft 365—including SharePoint, Teams and Exchange. It supports regulatory compliance, reduces the risk of data exposure in generative AI use cases and enables secure collaboration at scale—critical in today’s hybrid, AI-powered workplace. Security-Centric Migration and Consolidation – Leveraging Microsoft’s security suite, M365 E5 Security and integrated with Accenture’s E5 Acceleration Playbook, this solution accelerates migration to modern platforms while streamlining operations and simplifying toolsets. By consolidating legacy security solutions and optimizing licensing, organizations can achieve between 35% to 50% cost savings, reduce vendor complexity and unlock the full value of Microsoft E5[2]. Enhanced IAM – Powered by Microsoft Entra Suite, Accenture’s enhanced IAM solutions accelerate the transformation of outdated Active Directory environments while augmenting workforce access management, enterprise identity governance and administration, and passwordless authentication. The result is better user experience, stronger security protection and simplified identity governance at scale, helping organizations achieve between 30% to 50% cost efficiencies through reduced infrastructure, licensing consolidation and helpdesk overhead[2]....","Back What we do Capabilities Capabilities Cloud Customer Service Cybersecurity Data and Artificial Intelligence Digital Engineering and Manufacturing Ecosystem Partners Emerging Technology Finance and Risk Management Infrastructure and Capital Projects Learning Managed Services Marketing and Experience Metaverse Sales and Commerce Strategy Supply Chain Sustainability Talent and Organization Technology Transformation Industries Industries Aerospace and Defense Automotive Banking Capital Markets Chemicals Communications and Media Consumer Goods and Services Energy Health High Tech Industrial Insurance Life Sciences Natural Resources Public Service Private Equity Retail Software and Platforms Travel Utilities Back About Accenture Our organization Our organization Awards and Recognition Corporate Sustainability Industry Analyst Recognition Leaders Locations 360° Value Report Media & Investors Media & Investors Media Relations Investor Relations Board of Directors How we serve How we serve Strategy and Consulting Technology Operations Industry X Song Back Careers homepage Find a job Find a job Search for jobs Career areas Life at Accenture Life at Accenture Working here Benefits Work environment Careers blog How we hire How we hire Using AI Hiring journey Pro tips Reinvent what your business could be Our wide range of capabilities, ecosystem partnerships and unmatched industry expertise can help your business become the next best version of itself.

Infuse cybersecurity into your strategy and ecosystem to protect value, help prevent threat and build trust as you grow.

Fast-track your journey with integrated applications and platforms that bring the latest industry- and function-specific capabilities, plus advanced data and AI offerings, to empower your people and business. In a rapidly changing world, embrace emerging technology to transform and achieve greater efficiency, effectiveness, and breakthrough innovation. Amid intensifying market disruptions and escalating business volatility, there’s more pressure on Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) and Chief Risk Officers (CROs) to balance multiple interconnected transformations while sustaining company performance, profitability and safety. Combine human ingenuity with data and AI to deliver large-scale projects on time and within budget, while also achieving broader investment and sustainability objectives. While technology plays a key role in business reinvention, it’s your people who determine its success. How can you build the skills they want, and you need, to grow faster?

Boldly commit to continuous reinvention and join the small but growing number of companies reaching new levels of profitable growth for their businesses, while also providing greater contributions to humanity. Anticipate and respond to customer demand. Resilient by design and able to withstand disruptions, supply chain networks drive efficiency, sustainability and growth. Sustainability spans environmental, social and governance issues. Today every organization must embrace sustainability for future competitiveness. Thriving organizations are driving change at the intersection of technology and talent.
