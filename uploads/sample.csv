Blume Ventures - Chennai,https://www.blume.vc/,praveenpandiyan7991@gmail.com,022-43471659,"Unit 1, Jetha Industrial Compound, Opp Nirmal Park, Byculla East, Mumbai, Maharashtra","Blume's Beliefs - Blume Ventures Menu Home Blume's Beliefs Work With Us Initiatives People Portfolio Library News Search the site: Search Omega Files Episode 2Share Share via Email Share on WhatsApp Share on LinkedIn Share on X (Twitter) Blume's Beliefs Transformational Companies Are Led And Built By Revolutionary Founders. We Back These Founders Early And Remain Lifelong Partners. You cannot buy the revolution. You cannot make the revolution. You can only be the revolution. It is in your spirit, or it is nowhere. Ursula K Le Guin The Dispossessed In 2010, Karthik Reddy and Sanjay Nath founded Blume Ventures with a mission to reimagine startup financing for India. As passionate angel investors in the fledgling Indian startup ecosystem, they foresaw the evolution of the Indian startup founder and sought to create a firm that would support the Indian founder through the entire journey of starting up to scaling up. To do this, they founded a distinctive venture firm, one that could move with the speed of an angel investor, yet be institutionalised in its approach, bridging a gap between local angel networks and larger global venture capital firms.Over the years, Blume has grown by backing transformational ventures and revolutionary founders, becoming a key player in India’s startup ecosystem. En route, we have invested in and helped build over 100 startups across geographies and verticals. All these startups are united by a common theme: they are looking to solve uniquely Indian problems, ones that emerge out of the vast complexities of building for and operating in the Indian sub-continent, with its 23 official languages, distinct cultural groups and disparate income levels. While the solutions are for India, their aspirations and attitudes are global, and they remind us that the next wave of global startups are emerging out of India.Capital, counsel, and convictionThe distinctive nature of the Indian startup ecosystem and the unique context it operates in places a unique challenge on the founder. Blume is distinctive for its deep empathy for the founder’s hardships as well as the full range of support provided to make their journey easier. Our empathy with the founder’s quest and the challenges they face results from our deep commitment to the problems they work on as well as our personal motivations to effect change.Beyond the capital that we provide, to our founders, they also have on-demand counsel and support, via access to our services partners Constellation Blu (financial and legal advisory-cum-compliance), MetaMorph (recruitment), as well as our in house resources providing access to growth capital, sales and strategic partnerships and community. But beyond capital and counsel, we also provide conviction, sticking and standing by our founders through all the winding paths they take to achieve scale and success. Sometimes it doesn’t work out, for more often than not, startups are experiments that don’t succeed. Well, that is all right too, we then help pull the founders pull down shutters, and then get ready to back their next experiments. Backing founders and their unreasonable experiments, after all is what Blume was born for.Divided by motivation, united by ambitionThe founders who partner with us, or rather who we had the privilege of partnering with, are a diverse lot. They don’t fit any particular demographic profile nor do they conform to any specific pedigree. They may be building B2C ventures or B2B ventures. Their customers may be housewives in Bharat or enterprise CXOs in the Bay Area. Irrespective of these differences, we find that they are all obsessed with solving hard problems, usually one triggering a fundamental change in consumer behaviour and birthing large markets.We typically partner with these founders at a very early stage, helping them achieve product-market fit and power through the first point of scale. We bring in capital and counsel, but more importantly, we bring our conviction. We remain steadfast supporters to these founders, staying invested for anywhere from eight to ten years, and as long as the founders are equally invested in their ambition for the business. Supporting and sticking by founders and their crazy ambitions is what Blume was designed for. This is why Blume exists, and why we come excited to work every day. Transformational ventures are built by revolutionary founders.

Whether you’re an aspiring entrepreneur, a business leader, or simply curious about the legacy of one of India’s most iconic companies, this episode has something for everyone.Thanks to our annual partner IDFC First Bank and Sponsor Ultrahuman for making this episode possible.[00:00:00] Mukund Rajan: Mr. Tata ended up writing a letter which I have seen. He hand-wrote this letter to Prime Minister Vajpayee. It’s probably the fiercest condemnation of government policy that you would see from a corporate leader to the head of government in India. He was very keen to see whether this convergence of IT, communications, hardware, software, all of which is frankly supporting today’s, emergence of broadband, artificial intelligence, all the new applications that ride on the infrastructure.He would have loved to see that combination. Therefore, the one business I can tell you, he was most disappointed about was the fact that our telecoms business didn’t do well. Question the unquestioned, never accept somebody’s negativity, never accept that something can’t be done until you’ve actually given it a damn good shot and quite often you’ll find that it can happen. [00:01:08] Karthik Reddy: Welcome to another episode of the Blume podcast. Today, we’re thrilled to have Dr. Mukund Rajan with us, visionary leader, whose career embodies our theme Winning Beyond Boundaries. Dr. Rajan’s journey is a fascinating blend of academic excellence and corporate leadership. From being a Rhodes scholar at Oxford to serving as the first brand custodian of the Tata Group, he has consistently pushed the boundaries of what’s possible.During his remarkable 23-year tenure with the Tatas, he not only worked closely with Mr. Ratan Tata, but also witnessed the bold global initiatives of the Tatas first-hand. For our younger viewers, who may not be aware, the Tatas are the OG Indian business house when it comes to building enduring global businesses from India.Tata group companies with a considerable global footprint include TCS, Tata Motors, Tata Communications, and the Indian Hotel Company.

We’re witnessing a seismic shift as the world races to decarbonize, electrify, and supercharge infrastructure. The global population is rising, but more importantly, so are our living standards, both of which fuel this energy demand growth. But the primary drivers, and the major load additions to the grid will be through AI data centers, electrification of everything, and the relentless march of industrialization across markets is also driving this increase. But let’s be real, energy demand has always ridden the waves of globalization, tech booms and industrial surges. Today, it is the clean energy transition, and aftershocks of the pandemic are rewriting the playbook. Despite decades of climate pledges, fossil fuels still dominate the energy mix. The pressure to decarbonize isn’t just a talking point, it’s an existential imperative. Nuclear energy is a force multiplier here, but nuclear’s global share is still criminally underplayed at just 5 – 6%, shackled by hefty upfront costs and outdated public fears. This trend has taken a U‑turn in recent years with the greatest number of innovations and investments happening. This moment is turbocharged by a two-pronged tech arsenal, fission and fusion.Fission is the workhorse which splits uranium-235 to unleash clean, reliable energy. Sure, it’s got baggage (waste and perception), but it’s proven and indispensable. Fusion, though? That’s the moonshot. Imagine nearly limitless energy, 4x the punch per kilogram compared to fission with no long-lived radioactive waste, and fuel that’s everywhere. The catch? We’re still cracking the code on sustained net energy gain. But with recent breakthroughs lighting up both magnetic and inertial confinement fusion, and a tidal wave of capital flooding in, the fusion future is closer than ever. Resource Click here for the full report! Document The world stands at a pivotal moment as energy demand accelerates, driven by the proliferation of AI powered data centers, electrification of transport and industry, and rapid industrialization in emerging economies. By 2030, global energy consumption is projected to surge by 14% compared to 2024, with developing countries leading this growth. Each exajoule consumed is equivalent to 24 million tons of oil. The scale of the challenge is humongous and so is the urgency for scalable, low-carbon solutions. Global energy consumption rises, but so does CO₂ emissions, underscoring the scale of the decarbonization challenge. Despite decades of climate action, fossil fuels still account for a staggering 81% of global energy use, as shown in the donut chart. Coal, oil, and natural gas continue to dominate, while clean fuels including nuclear, hydro, and other renewables make up less than a fifth of the mix. This heavy reliance on carbon intensive sources is the primary driver of rising emissions.The bar chart on the right tracks annual CO₂ emission growth rates, highlighting the pandemic’s temporary dip in 2020, followed by a sharp rebound in 2021 as economies reopened. While recent years show a slowdown in emission growth, this is largely due to aggressive governmental policies and investments in clean energy, rather than a fundamental shift in the energy system. The reality is, to keep global warming below 1.5°C, we must achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, meaning every ton of CO₂ from fossil fuels must be offset or eliminated. All in all, incremental progress is not enough, a systemic transformation is essential, and the window to act is narrowing. The reliability of nuclear power is gaining recognition among technology giants. As AI and data center energy demands are projected to increase 5x by 2035, companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are making strategic bets on nuclear to ensure continuous, low-carbon power for digital infrastructure, something renewables alone cannot guarantee. Today, nuclear fission provides about 25% of the world’s low-carbon electricity, serving as a backbone for reliable, large-scale power generation. Fission works by splitting heavy atomic nuclei, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239 releasing approximately 200 MeV (million electron volts) of energy per fission event. This immense energy density means that just 1 gram of uranium can produce about 1 megawatt-day of energy, equivalent to burning 3 tons of coal or 600 gallons of fuel oil. In practical terms, the energy density of fission fuels is about one million times greater than fossil fuels.Howeve...",Not found
